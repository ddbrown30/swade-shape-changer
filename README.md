# SWADE Shape Changer

This module for Foundry VTT adds functionality to help automate various forms of transformation. For all transformations, if the token is in a combat, the module automatically updates the combatant with the new token.

For the shape change power, it handles creating and swapping to a new token and transferring edges, hindrances, attributes, skills, powers, power points, bennies, wounds, and fatigue as described by the Shape Change power.

For werewolves from the Horror Companion, it handles transforming your werewolf into a human by swapping the token art and removing all the werewolf abilities, edges, and the silvered weapons weakness.

For more detailed instructions for each type of transformation, see the wiki.
